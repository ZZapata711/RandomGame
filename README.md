This is a console based interactive program which pairs with a seperate .txt file containing a list of some games I own, and randomly chooses which game should play.
Also provides functionality to add, remove, and view which games are in the list. 
I built this program when I was bored one day and did not know which game I should play from of a considerably large backlog of games that I wanted to try.
